v 0.9.0 - October 2012

- Pub: Dart Vector Math now fully supports the pub package management system!
- API++: Minor changes to the API everywhere. The changes improve the aesthetics and performance of the library.
- Faster: Lots of performance tweaks resulting in the library getting faster and generating less garbage.
- 2D Cross Product: The Box2D Dart port requires a 2D cross product.
- Library Split: Two libraries, one for browser applications and console applications.

v 0.8.5 - July 29 2012

- 33% faster matrix matrix multiply
- Fix generated operator[]= 
- Fix OpenGL lookat and perspective matrix constructors
- Fix mat4x4 rotation constructors
- Fix mat4x4 multiplied with vector3 not applying translation
- Add utility methods for moving between Dart Vector Math types and Float32Array/Float32List types
- Add mat4x4 translation constructor
- Fixed buildPlaneVectors method
- Fix mat4x4 transformDirect3 not applying translation
- Add a new variant of mix() that takes the parameter t as a num or a vector
